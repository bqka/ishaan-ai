To create a website that assists dyslexic and neurodiverse individuals in reading, chatting, and engaging with text-based content, we can integrate multiple features with accessibility-focused design. Here's how we can achieve it:
1. Features & Implementation
A. Text Processing & Readability Enhancements
Summarization (AI-powered):


Implement NLP-based text summarization (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face Transformers, or spaCy).


Users can paste or upload text, and the system will generate a concise summary.


Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech:


Integrate Web Speech API or Google's Speech-to-Text for voice input.


Use ResponsiveVoice.js or Amazon Polly for text-to-speech conversion.


Text Formatting for Readability:


Adjustable spacing, font size, and line height (e.g., OpenDyslexic font).


High-contrast mode and color overlays for better visual support.


Word highlighting to track reading progress.


B. Real-time Chat Assistance
Transliteration & Grammar Correction:


AI-powered grammar correction for dyslexic users (e.g., Grammarly API).


Convert Hindi transliterated text (e.g., â€˜Kya hal haiâ€™) into proper Hindi or English.


AI Chatbot for Communication Help:


Context-aware chatbot for simplifying complex sentences.


Pre-built response suggestions to ease communication.


C. Assistive Features for Navigation & Accessibility
Browser Extension (for External Websites):


Convert difficult text into easier language.


Read aloud any webpage content with a click.


User Personalization:


Save accessibility preferences (e.g., text size, voice speed).


Dark mode, color filters for visual comfort.


2. Tech Stack & Development Approach
Frontend: React.js (for dynamic UI/UX).


Backend: Flask/Django or Node.js (for handling AI processing).


Database: PostgreSQL or Firebase (for storing user preferences).


AI Models: OpenAI GPT, T5 (for summarization & translation).


APIs & Libraries: Web Speech API, NLP libraries (spaCy, Hugging Face), Accessibility.js.


3. Future Enhancements
Multi-language support.


Mobile app version for accessibility on the go.


Integration with productivity tools like Google Docs or WhatsApp.
A. Text Summarization
ðŸ“Œ Goal: Allow users to paste/upload text and get a simplified summary.
ðŸ”§ How to do it:
Frontend:


Create a textarea where users can enter text.

E. Transliteration & Grammar Correction
ðŸ“Œ Goal: Convert Hindi transliterated text (e.g., "Kya hal hai") into proper Hindi or English.
ðŸ”§ How to do it:
Frontend:


Create an input field where users type in Hinglish.


Add a "Convert" button.


Backend:


Use Google Translate API or an NLP model to convert Hinglish to Hindi/English.
